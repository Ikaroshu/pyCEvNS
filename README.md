# pyCEvNS - an open-source CEvNS calculator with MCMC sampling of new physics parameters and experimental systematics
pyCEvNS is an effort advanced by phenomenologists and experimentalists within the coherent, elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) community.
The goal is to provide a robust, (relatively) easy-to-use tool for *performing calculations of the CEvNS differential cross section* defining the expected distribution of CEvNS events in nuclear-recoil energy space.

A key component of pyCEvNS is the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to incorporate the effects both of new physics and of uncertainties in the recoil calculation.
This allows for robust analyses of CEvNS data, including the ability to incorporate multiple experimental inputs.

# Status
As of April 2018, development is in its early stages.
Usage notes and contribution guidelines will be added to this and other READMEs as development advances.

# Initial contributors
The pyCEvNS project was started by members of Texas A&M University, Duke University, and the University of Chicago.
